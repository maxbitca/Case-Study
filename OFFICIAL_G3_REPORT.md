INTRODUCTION

Over the past few decades, online privacy has had a clear transition from a background issue to a prominent issue in digital life. This has been fueuled by the expansion of the internet, social media, artificial intelligence, and data-driven business models. Historically anonymous online spaces have developed into tightly tracked environments where users constantly share personal details while governments and corporations collect, analyse, and monetise their data. This project examines online privacy through four key ideas: historical development, societal attitudes, business practices, and ethics.


HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT [Maxim]

# Historical Development of Online Privacy  
**Author:** Max

## Timeline of Key Events

The development of online privacy has grown alongside the rise of the internet. In the early days, most users did not worry much about who could access their information because the internet was new and not widely understood. Each stage of the internet brought new risks, leading businesses and governments to think differently about how personal information should be protected.

---

## 1990–2000

In the early days of the internet around 1993, online spaces operated with very limited legal regulation (Ring, 2023). Most users accessed the internet through web browsers which allowed anonymity (Tadlock, 2019). Privacy concerns were focused on personal safety and controlling what users directly shared. Commercial tracking was extremely limited, and websites normally only stored basic registration details such as email addresses.

Cookies were introduced in 1994 as a simple mechanism to store user preferences (Internet Law Program, 2011), but few people understood their long-term implications. Governments also lacked digital structures, allowing companies to experiment with early data collection. Although privacy was not considered a major concern, early researchers noticed the growing imbalance between companies collecting data and users unknowingly providing it.

---

## 2000–2010

The early 2000s saw major growth in online shopping and advertising. Companies realised that user data could be used for personalisation and targeted marketing, and data collection became more automated. Websites began using third-party trackers without user awareness.

Social networks such as MySpace (2003) and Facebook (2004) encouraged account registration using real personal information, shifting online behaviour from anonymous to public. Sharing personal information became normal, and what began as casual interaction slowly turned into valuable commercial data for companies (Privacy International, 2021).

---

## 2010–2020

By the 2010s, user data had become a commercial asset. In 2013, Edward Snowden revealed that governments were engaging in mass data collection and surveillance (Greenwald, 2013). This increased public concern and led to stronger data protection laws such as GDPR in 2018, requiring companies to be transparent about how they collect and use data.

Cookie banners became common, but most users simply clicked “accept” to continue browsing faster (Kitowska, 2022). By the end of the decade, online privacy was no longer just a technical topic but a legal and ethical issue.

---

## 2020–2025

From 2020 onwards, online privacy entered a new phase with the rise of artificial intelligence. AI systems do not just collect data; they analyse and learn from it. This led companies to gather more information than ever, including location and facial recognition. Face ID became widely used for authentication—convenient, but risky if leaked.

Social media platforms like TikTok encouraged public sharing through stories and livestreams, sometimes prioritising engagement over privacy. Even with awareness of the risks, many users continued sharing for visibility. The future of online privacy now depends on how responsibly organisations manage and protect personal data.

TWO VIEWPOINTS: BUSINESS [Leah]

(1.The rise of data driven business models )
In the early 2000’s a new type of business currency came around, user data. (Business 
Money, 2024) stated that companies could target customers more successfully online by 
just using information as it was a lot more accessible and valuable. Many platforms including Google and Facebook started to use people’s personalized data, which in turn led to major profit (RTE, 2025). This gave businesses a major advantage as it improved targeting. In December 2025, Meta stated that AI would be gradually rolled in to personalise content and ads for users (Meta, n.d.). Over the past few years, stricter regulations have been brought in around how data is shared and collected, there were uncertain laws surrounding this issue in the past (AC, 2025). Gradually companies began to understand that data had not only information value, but also financial value (Laarhoven-Smits, 2023). 

(2.Regulation and business transformation )
In the past, the laws were not as strict and companies and businesses had more free will to 
do what they wanted with this data. After the GDPR came into place, businesses were 
forced to change the way they handled this data to meet compliance standards. This cost 
approximately 58% of businesses in Ireland between €50,000 and €250,000 to provide 
training and pay for relevant costs, which put financial pressure on them (McCannFitzgerald, 
2018). Many of these businesses were required to add consent forms and hire data 
protection officers (GeeksForGeeks, 2025). In May 2023, Meta received a fine of 1.2 billion 
euros for breaching GDPR (Kramer, 2023), this caused a lot of backlashes towards the 
company and shows how non-compliance can negatively impact a brand’s reputation. It 
became clear that it was important to take data protection into consideration for both a 
business strategy and social responsibility (IBM, n.d.). These laws created a demand for 
more roles like cybersecurity (GPDR Advisor, n.d.). 

(3. Privacy as a competitive advantage) 
Privacy is no longer considered only a legal requirement, but a way to build a business’ 
reputation. The rising concern over user privacy has made businesses more aware of how 
important it is to be trustworthy with users’ data as it is a key factor in competition 
(Goswami, 2020). Companies like Apple use privacy as part of their brand by attracting 
customers who care about security, which in turn leads to brand loyalty (UMATechnology, 
2025). According to a Deloitte survey, 81% of customers reported that having trust in a 
company’s data practices affects their decision of whether to purchase their product 
(Akomolafe, 2025). This highlights how important privacy is to customers. Acting responsibly 
with data helps keep customers loyal while also strengthening the company’s brand image 
(Allen, 2024). Like a company’s reputation of their products quality, their reputation of trust 
is equally as important.  
 
(4. Corporate Digital Responsibility and Ethics. )
Corporate digital responsibility refers to certain practices and behaviors businesses use to 
ethically manage technology and data (CorporateDigitalResponsibility, n.d.). Businesses 
must inform users how their data is being stored.  This is to prove they are transparent with 
the users and they should explain what information is being collected by using privacy 
statements, this is essential for building customer trust (EY, 2024).  Companies must use AI 
ethically to ensure that artificial intelligence systems are fair to prevent ethical issues and 
maintain customer trust (IBM, n.d.). Strong cybersecurity measures must be put in place by 
businesses in order to protect customer data and prevent privacy issues (Legal Clarity, 
2025). Many companies hire data protection officers to ensure compliance and responsible 
behavior to guarantee they follow the GDPR regulations (UCD, n.d.).  

(5. The Future Business Landscape  )
Over time businesses will move towards relying on technology to reduce manual labor for a 
faster and more effective workflow (bairesdev, 2025). As people continue to work from 
home, it is crucial for user data protection to be secured to protect them from data 
breaches and cyberattacks. Home systems are generally less secure which increases the risk 
of data exposure (GDPR Advisor, n.d.). Users are becoming more aware of how their data is 
being used so companies will have to ensure they have stronger governance practices 
otherwise businesses may lose customer trust (Riskrecon, 2025). As new privacy laws set 
into place, businesses will have to follow strict rules to ensure customer loyalty and protect 
their brand image.

TWO VIEWPOINTS: SOCIETAL [Emily]

(1. Historical Evolution of Online Privacy Norms) 

Historically, the US Government first started collecting data on citizens in the early 1960s. This data was collected for a multitude of reasons; tax, law enforcement etc. When the World Wide Web became operational to the public domain in 1993 (Ring, 2023), it changed how businesses and the government could collect and look at user data. This has led to new privacy concerns. Online privacy norms have evolved from focusing on physical intrusion to managing extensive data collection and interconnectedness. Prior the 21st century with the ‘Open Internet’ (Internet Law Program, 2011), online spaces were relatively anonymous with weak regulations. Many users under names that hid their identity (Tadlock, 2019), and their personal details only released to other users directly. In a modern online era, user information is both fairly regulated yet publicised simultaneously especially with the development of terms and conditions and cookies. T&Cs act as a strategic barrier: by overwhelming users with excessive legal detail that we all accept in assimilation (Kitowska, 2022), companies secure consent for practices that users might reject if the terms were clear and accessible which leads us to question their strength at protecting us. Yet the real threat to our online privacy are the social norms equated to its use. Plastering on Instagram and TikTok our daily lives and schedules, what we are eating/wearing, where we are. We transitioned from a social media with anonymity to voluntarily being fooled into sharing intimate relations and activities with strangers out of conformity.



(2. Cultural and Social Attitudes) 

Cultural norms strongly shape how people interpret privacy risks and what feels “normal” to share. Older generations often associate privacy with secrecy, modesty, and clear boundaries between home and public life (Nyanzi, 2025), while many 'Gen Z’ users have grown up with social media and see constant sharing as routine, even expected. It is almost concerning if you are not sharing your life publicly nowadays. In fact, it is almost concerning to not be chronically online sharing your every moment. At the same time, the “nothing to hide” idea coexists with anxiety about stalking, doxxing, and reputational damage (Worsley et al., 2017). With ‘Cancel Culture’ in a modern media era (EBSCO Research, 2024), it is almost vital to disclose all aspects of one’s life to prevent social destruction which oftens expands further than online media reaching public humiliation. Primarily in western culture, sharing online can be profitable with TikTok introducing subscriptions: a monetisation feature allowing creators to offer exclusive perks to followers who pay a recurring monthly fee (Agnikii Digital, 2024). These exclusive perks can include more intimate information and videos shared. Online privacy is now an asset to profit off. Social platforms blur lines between public and private by encouraging disclosure to broad, mixed audiences. The design - Instagram stories, TikTok and Instagram “what’s on your mind?” prompts (figure 1) - encourages regular disclosure as a normal, even expected, part of social life. People constantly negotiate what to post, who can see it, and how their self‑presentation will be judged by peers, employers, and institutions and online privacy is negotiated based on social norms, not just individual preference (Sustainability Directory).



(3. Future of Online Privacy: Ethics, AI and Social Trust) 

Emerging technologies such as AI and biometric systems amplifies ethical questions about online privacy and social trust. AI systems depend on massive datasets (Concord, no date), increasing incentives for continuous collection to fuel these AI algorithms and repurposing of personal information, often in ways individuals cannot foresee, such as agreeing to unknown terms and conditions simply to obtain access to a website. Society as a community must respond demanding privacy‑enhancing technologies, stronger regulation, clearly articulated uses of data, new norms around transparency and accountability for data uses. New social media norms are essential to a change in online privacy at the hands of the user. The future of online privacy will depend on whether institutions can show that they can be trusted with data and on how much people believe that digital systems value their right to privacy, fairness, and democratic participation.

ETHICAL Matthew

In the modern world, it is necessary for many businesses and organisations to collect user data in order to operate. However, the volume and sensitivity of this data may vary depending on what the specific data is. “Data fuels innovation; therefore, it is critical to have a framework that focuses on regulating how organizations obtain, process, and use data.” (VCE, 2024) Organisations are legally required to obtain consent from an end user before collecting their data. However, the ethics behind what data must be collected and what data must remain private are not always clear.  

  

There are instances where the collection of private data could be considered as justified. For example, law enforcement may require sensitive data regarding an individual in order to stop or investigate crimes (Santa Clara University, 2013). Personal Data is also useful in the Healthcare Sector. "Data collection in healthcare allows health systems to create holistic views of patients, personalize treatments, advance treatment methods, improve communication between doctors and patients, and enhance health outcomes."(Natallia Sakovich, No Date). The collection of certain personal information by healthcare organisations can be used to provide personalised healthcare at a huge scale. 

However, collecting too much of this information makes it easier to exploit or misuse. "Medical data is financially valuable, and your sensitive data may be shared or sold by doctors, hospitals, clinical laboratories, and pharmacies—without your knowledge or consent...In addition to data harms related to exposure and discrimination, the collection of sensitive data by powerful corporations risks the creation of data monopolies that can dominate and condition access to health care."(Carissa Véliz, 2019) 

Balancing this need for information with the rights and privacy of individuals, as well as ensuring this information is handled responsibly, and not used solely for profit or to influence biases, is an incredibly important but also incredibly difficult task. 

  

When accepting cookies on a website, explanations for what the user is consenting to can be long-winded and overcomplicated, accompanied by options like “accept all” and “manage” with no option to reject essential and a lack of clarity around what essential cookies are collecting, making it difficult to understand and leading to uninformed consent (Annmarie Hanlon and Karen Jones, 2023) as it is unrealistic for a user browsing the internet to fully read the terms and conditions for every website they visit. 

Additionally, users are often not aware of what is being done with their data and what the intent behind its collection is, which leads them to be further uninformed. 

Such a case happened with Facebook in 2018, where a political analytics firm had used an external application to pay users to partake in a personality quiz. Unbeknownst to these users, their information and that of themselves was being used to create psychological profiles on users based on their liked posts and other sensitive information, such as their home addresses, and use this information for political campaigns. (University of Greater Manchester, 2021) The end users were giving uninformed consent, leading to their data being used in ways that had neither foreseen nor intended.  

  

For privacy and security to be protected in today’s society, the current laws surrounding privacy protection, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) need to be revised and/or adjusted. Stricter laws must be put in place about exceeding how much of the end user's data is required for the organisation to operate and where this data is being stored and sent. The requirements Organisations should have to meet to be allowed to store and use sensitive information should be more demanding and less indefinite (E.g requiring a Security Certificate) 

It should also be a requirement for Organisations to be more transparent with their cookies, allowing users to reject them in bulk without access to the website being revoked or locked behind a paywall, as is the case for some websites where a monthly or yearly fee must be paid in order for certain cookies to remain disabled. "Consumers seeking to protect their personal data while browsing are confronted with the dilemma: pay up or surrender your privacy through cookie paywalls. Accept or reject and incur a subscription fee to opt out – a decision that could cost up to $75 per year for a single site."(Syrenis, 2024) These are not currently explicitly illegal, but should not be allowed if there is to be protection of the User's privacy in the future. Websites should be required to use a free, clear, and accessible display of the data they collect and allow the user to opt out of as much of this data as possible if they so choose.

CONCLUSION

Our report demonstrate that online privacy is molded by the combination of historical trends, cultural expectations, corporate strategies, and ethical frameworks. Data has become a powerful asset for businesses and institutions, but unchecked collection, consent mechanisms, and intrusive surveillance threaten user autonomy, equality, and social trust. Addressing these challenges will require updated regulations, transparency, and new social norms that empower users to protect their information while still participating fully in digital life.
